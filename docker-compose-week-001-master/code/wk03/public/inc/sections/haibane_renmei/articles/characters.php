    <h3>Rakka</h3>
    <p>A new arrival at Old Home, Rakka struggles throughout the series to "find herself," and has trouble escaping from curiosity about her past. She forms many friendships, but her closest is with Reki. It is implied that she died in the fall that features in her cocoon dream. Someone precious to her (represented by a crow throughout the narrative) tried to save her, but failed, and was hurt by the event. Rakka is very quiet and a bit on the withdrawn side. She spends a lot of time pondering her previous existence and the mysteries of what lies beyond the Walls, as well as the origin of the Haibane.</p>

    <h3>Reki</h3>
    <p>Reki is a mother figure to the other Haibane of Old Home. Reki cannot remember her "cocoon dream," is troubled by her past at Old Home and by vivid and horrible nightmares, which she then paints as a way of trying to figure them out. She has been a Haibane for seven years, longer than the others except for Nemu. She spends her time taking care of the precocious pack of Young Feathers who clearly drive her crazy but whom she seems to love unconditionally.</p>
