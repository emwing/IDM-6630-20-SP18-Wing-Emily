      <h3>Yuri Katsuki</h3>
      <p>The main protagonist, Yuri is a 23-year-old figure skater. Yuri began skating at a very young age and aspires to become a great figure skater like his idol, Victor Nikiforov. As stated by his teacher Minako, Yuri is not a prodigy at skating, but his skills were honed by rigorous training, which also grants him good stamina. He is Japan's top figure skater; his greatest skating assets being his peculiar sense of rhythm and unique step. However, Yuri succumbs to pressure easily, causing him to mess up at crucial moments. After failing his first appearance at the Grand Prix Final, his self-confidence was greatly affected, succumbing to extreme anxiety due to his shortcomings and performances in following competitions, thus leaving a black mark on his career, and resulting in his returning home after being away for 5 years.</p>
      <p>Yuri is kind, sensitive, and mild-mannered; he is also introverted and has a hard time opening himself up to others, preferring to be alone and practice ballet or ice skating than socializing with his peers. Despite having a lot of support from his family and friends, he greatly lacks self-esteem and is easily discouraged, causing bouts of anxiety. Contrary to how Yuri sees himself due to his past failures, he is still considered Japan's best skater, having the loyal support of his fans and the juniors skaters who look up to him, much to his bewilderment. Under Victor's tutelage, Yuri slowly becomes more self-assured and confident, aiming to reinvent himself and putting more input into his programs as he strives to win the 2016-2017 Grand Prix series.</p>

At the start of the series, Victor wins the 2015-2016 World Championships marking him the five-time consecutive winner and people begin to question what he will do next season, as he is approaching the retirement age for most figure skaters. Victor's personal motto is to "Do the opposite of what people expect, that is the only way you will surprise them!". He shows this through his skating programs as he creates his own choreography and music. However, he loses his inspiration to make new routines because he knows people have grown used to his record-breaking talent. After seeing Yuri K. skating his winning routine in a viral video, Victor regains his inspiration and decides to become Yuri K.'s coach to unlock his full potential.</p>
      <p>As the top skater in the world, Victor is very popular and charismatic, as well as being flirtatious and liking to speak his mind. As stated by Yakov, his coach, Victor does whatever he wants and often gives off a whimsical, carefree attitude. When he needs to be, Victor can be serious and contemplative, especially in regards to skating. As a coach, Victor is very patient and supportive, yet he challenges and helps push Yuri K. into exploring his untapped potential and charm.</p>
